\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Since the S\+PI mode is the only supported interface data can not be written/read to/from the General Purpose Buffer directly. Instead memory access is achieved through a data window. A pointer register indicates where the data gets written to or read from, respectively. Data can then be exchanged through a dedicated register (data window).
