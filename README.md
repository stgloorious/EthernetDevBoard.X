## Introduction

Due to the increased market demand of internet-enabled devices it
has become a preferable skill for engineers to be familiar with the basic
principles of a network. I created this Ethernet Development Board
as a learning platform for myself to develop network-enabled hardware
and software. It offers a stand-alone solution with an 100Base-TX Ethernet Controller (ENC424J600) 
which can be used in conjuction with the on-board microcontroller (PIC18F25K50). 
Alternatively, the board can also be used as a daughterboard for an Altera DE0-nano FPGA board 
to add 100Base-TX Ethernet functionalities to it.

To really understand what's going on I wanted to create as much as possible from scratch.
